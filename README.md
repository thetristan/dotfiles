### Overview

This is what I use to get set up on a new environment running zsh and mvim.


### Installing

WARNING: Before running `setup.sh`, know and understand that this setup script will blow away any existing dotfiles you have.

To install, clone dotfiles into your home folder and then run `setup.sh`.
